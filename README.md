## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam and I'm agile front-end developer. My current goal is to become a Software Architect.

Why I call myself an "agile" developer? 

Because one of my "drivers" is to understand the business context of my work.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular, basics of Software Architecture and increasing my "basic" knowledge of JavaScript.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any front-end project

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Agile, Scrum, React, Web Development

:trophy: My most recent achievement: PAL-I (Professional Agile Leadership 1) certificate.
