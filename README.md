### Hi there 👋

My name is Adam and I'm agile front-end developer. My current goal is to become a Software Architect.

Why I call myself an "agile" developer? 

Because on of my "drivers" is to understand the business context of my work.

<!-- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... -->

🌱 I’m currently learning Angular, .NET and basics of Software Architecture

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any front-end project

💬 Ask me about Agile, Scrum, React, Web Development

:trophy: My most recent achievement: PAL-I (Professional Agile Leadership 1) certificate.
